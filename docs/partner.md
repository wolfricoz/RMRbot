RMRbot also supports our sister server Roleplay Meets: Network which specializes in partnerships, currently
there is a single command for this server, as it uses all of RMR's tools too (except for advert commands)

#### mod: `/partnerapprove (category) (member) (servername)`
This command approves a partnership and creates the channel for it, gives the user the appropriate partner role as well
as pings the user in the channel with the instructions on what to do next.
