<h1 align="center">setup</h1>
RMRbot's setup is relatively painless, and has to only be done once when the bot joins. Since the bot is only
designed for two servers: RMR and RMN. A lot of the setup has been done through the code while my newer bots have
a more flexible and dynamic design. 

#### Admin: `?config (option) (input: Role or Channel)`
**Config options**:<br> 
• lobby #channel<br>
• agelog #channel<br>
• modlobby #channel<br>
• general #channel<br>
• admin @role<br>
• mod @role<br>
• trial @role<br>
• lobbystaff @role<br>

The roles are required for the bot's permission system and the channels are required for the age commands, without they will
throw up a reminder to do the configuarion command. This is meant to be used by Rico.
