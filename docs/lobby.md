<h1 align="center">Lobby Commands & info </h1>
The lobby is the area where users enter our server, this area is incredibly important and to ensure the
safety of our users, we check their dobs and ages with previous entries in our database. 

### Lobby automod

The automod in the lobby does a few things, it enforces a template of age mm/dd/yyyy, once this is filled in the automod
posts a message in the lobby moderation channel. The bot takes the information and formats it for the staff to easily 
execute the command.

If a user is underaged, the bot will automatically flag them for the ID list. **it does NOT save underaged user's data other than the uid.**
