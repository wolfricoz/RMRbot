### about
Roleplay Meets: Reborn Bot (RMRbot, also known as dumpster dud named by our local void) is an utility bot
for Roleplay Meets: Reborn and Roleplay meets: Network. It was started last year in augustus and uploaded to
github in september 2022. 

The bot is meant to be the backbone of the server and thus handles a lot of the day-to-day. It runs next to 
YAGPDB to ensure full coverage of all the tools my staff would need. RMRbot provides auto moderation
for our advert channels and lobby; while also having a whole suite of commands for other sections in the server
